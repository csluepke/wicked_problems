# Wicked Problems 
### Hi! My name is Chiara Luepke. I am from Arlington, VA, and I am planning on majoring in Economics, either with an International Relations double-major or a finance minor. I love to dance and have been Irish dancing since I was five. I also enjoy theater, traveling, and spending time with friends. I am looking forward to this class as it is a totally new subject for me!
